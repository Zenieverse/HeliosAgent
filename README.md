# HeliosAgent
Helios Agent - AI DevOps Dashboard, an autonomous cloud operations and compliance engineer that monitors, optimizes, and remediates AWS environments using reasoning-driven AI. It acts as your always-on AI DevOps partner — using Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, SageMaker, and AWS Lambda to automate complex tasks like cost optimization, instance rightsizing, anomaly detection, and security compliance.





🚀 What It Does
Continuously observes AWS CloudWatch metrics, billing data, and configurations.
Uses a reasoning LLM (via Bedrock/Nova) to diagnose inefficiencies or misconfigurations.
Executes remediations (e.g., stopping idle EC2s, resizing instances, updating IAM policies) via Lambda + SDK autonomously.
Integrates with Amazon Q for conversational oversight — developers can chat with Helios to review its actions and plans.
Builds a dynamic “system health map” visualized in the frontend.
🏗️ Architecture Overview
Core components:
Amazon Bedrock (Nova) — reasoning LLM for decision-making
Amazon Bedrock AgentCore — agent orchestration and tool-calling layer
Amazon SageMaker — hosts cost anomaly models (predictive module)
AWS Lambda — executes remediation tasks
Amazon S3 — stores audit logs
Amazon API Gateway — frontend ↔ agent communication
Amazon Q — natural-language interaction
Frontend (React/Next.js) — real-time dashboard and conversational interface
💡 Innovation
Unlike traditional monitoring tools, Helios Agent doesn’t just alert — it reasons and acts.
It blends LLM reasoning, predictive ML models, and secure automation primitives to keep infrastructure compliant, efficient, and cost-optimized — autonomously.
