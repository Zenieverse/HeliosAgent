# HeliosAgent
Helios Agent - AI DevOps Dashboard, an autonomous cloud operations and compliance engineer that monitors, optimizes, and remediates AWS environments using reasoning-driven AI. It acts as your always-on AI DevOps partner — using Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, SageMaker, and AWS Lambda to automate complex tasks like cost optimization, instance rightsizing, anomaly detection, and security compliance.

🚀 What It Does
Continuously observes AWS CloudWatch metrics, billing data, and configurations.
Uses a reasoning LLM (via Bedrock/Nova) to diagnose inefficiencies or misconfigurations.
Executes remediations (e.g., stopping idle EC2s, resizing instances, updating IAM policies) via Lambda + SDK autonomously.
Integrates with Amazon Q for conversational oversight — developers can chat with Helios to review its actions and plans.
Builds a dynamic “system health map” visualized in the frontend.
🏗️ Architecture Overview
Core components:
Amazon Bedrock (Nova) — reasoning LLM for decision-making
Amazon Bedrock AgentCore — agent orchestration and tool-calling layer
Amazon SageMaker — hosts cost anomaly models (predictive module)
AWS Lambda — executes remediation tasks
Amazon S3 — stores audit logs
Amazon API Gateway — frontend ↔ agent communication
Amazon Q — natural-language interaction
Frontend (React/Next.js) — real-time dashboard and conversational interface
💡 Innovation
Unlike traditional monitoring tools, Helios Agent doesn’t just alert — it reasons and acts.
It blends LLM reasoning, predictive ML models, and secure automation primitives to keep infrastructure compliant, efficient, and cost-optimized — autonomously.

🌞 Inspiration
Modern cloud environments have grown too complex for manual management. Enterprises spend millions on over-provisioned resources, security gaps, and compliance violations that go unnoticed until it’s too late.
We wanted to build an AI-powered DevOps engineer — a system that not only monitors but reasons, decides, and acts autonomously to maintain cloud health, cost efficiency, and compliance at scale.
⚙️ What It Does
Helios Agent is an autonomous AI CloudOps system built on AWS Bedrock, SageMaker, and AgentCore.
It continuously analyzes AWS cloud environments using metrics, logs, and configurations, then:
Detects anomalies in costs, performance, or compliance.
Reasons about corrective actions using an LLM hosted on Amazon Bedrock.
Executes remediations through Lambda functions — such as rightsizing instances, rotating IAM keys, or adjusting budgets.
Explains its actions via a conversational interface powered by Amazon Q.
Helios Agent acts as your tireless AI teammate — always optimizing, always learning.
🧱 How We Built It
Amazon Bedrock AgentCore: orchestrates reasoning and autonomous task execution.
SageMaker AI: hosts predictive models for cost and performance anomaly detection.
AWS Lambda: executes system actions securely.
Amazon Q: enables natural-language conversations with the agent.
API Gateway + S3 + CloudWatch: connect the front-end dashboard to the backend.
React/Next.js Frontend: real-time DevOps dashboard built from our App Canvas prompt.
Infrastructure-as-Code: deployment handled through a deploy.sh script and CloudFormation templates.
🚧 Challenges We Ran Into
Integrating reasoning LLM outputs with secure AWS API calls without exposing credentials.
Designing agent autonomy boundaries — when to act vs when to request human approval.
Creating an intuitive UI that balances transparency and automation.
Cost optimization during LLM reasoning loops using Bedrock primitives efficiently.
🏆 Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
Successfully deployed an end-to-end autonomous Bedrock AgentCore pipeline with reasoning and execution.
Designed a scalable architecture that can expand across multiple AWS accounts.
Created a real-time AI dashboard that visualizes system actions and health insights dynamically.
Built the foundation for a production-grade AI CloudOps co-pilot.
📚 What We Learned
Deep understanding of AWS Bedrock’s AgentCore orchestration and reasoning primitives.
Integration of LLMs with SageMaker ML models for hybrid AI systems.
How to balance autonomy, safety, and interpretability in AI operations.
The importance of human-in-the-loop verification in autonomous agent design.
🚀 What’s Next for Helios Agent
